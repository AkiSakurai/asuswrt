QCA TZLOG

This binding describes tzlog used to inspect log created by TZ. This driver
also provides capability to capture SMMU and XPU faults found by TZ.

Required properties:
 - compatible: must contain one of "qca,tzlog"
				   "qca,tz64-hv-log"
				   "qca,tz64log"
 - interrupts: must contain interrupt used by TZ when XPU or SMMU faults are
		found

Example:

	qca,tzlog {
		compatible = "qca,tz64log";
		interrupts = <0 244 0>;
	};

	qca,tzlog {
		compatible = "qca,tz64-hv-log";
		interrupts = <0 244 0>;
	};

	qca,tzlog {
		compatible = "qca,tzlog";
	};
