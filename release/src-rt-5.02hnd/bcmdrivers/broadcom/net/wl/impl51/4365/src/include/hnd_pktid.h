/*
 * Compress a 32bit pkt pointer to 16bit unique ID to save memory in storing
 * pointers to packets. [In NIC mode (as opposed to dongle modes), there is no
 * memory constraint ... In NIC mode a pkt pointer may be 64bits. If a packet
 * pointer to packet ID suppression is desired in NIC mode, then the ability to
 * specify the maximum number of packets and a global pktptr_map is required.
 *
 * When a packet is first allocated from the heap, an ID is associated with it.
 * Packets allocated from the heap and filled into a pktpool will also get a
 * unique packet ID. When packets are allocated and freed into the pktpool, the
 * packet ID is preserved. In rte, lb_alloc() and lb_free_one() are the
 * only means to first instantiate (allocate from heap and initialize) a packet.
 * Packet ID management is performed in these functions.
 *
 * The lifetime of a packet ID is from the time it is allocated from the heap
 * until it is freed back to the heap.
 *
 * Packet ID 0 is reserved and never used and corresponds to NULL pktptr.
