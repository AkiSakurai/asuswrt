AVS Capture Frame Format
Version 2

1. Introduction
The original header format for "monitor mode" or capturing frames was
a considerable hack.  The document covers a redesign of that format.

2. Frame Format
All sniff frames follow the same format:

	Offset	Name		Size		Description
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	0	CaptureHeader			AVS capture metadata header
	64	802.11Header	[10-30]		802.11 frame header
	??	802.11Payload	[0-2312]	802.11 frame payload
	??	802.11FCS	4		802.11 frame check sequence

Note that the header and payload are variable length and the payload
may be empty.

If the hardware does not supply the FCS to the driver, then the frame shall
have a FCS of 0xFFFFFFFF.

3. Byte Order
All multibyte fields of the capture header are in "network" byte
order.  The "host to network" and "network to host" functions should
work just fine.  All the remaining multibyte fields are ordered
according to their respective standards.

4. Capture Header Format
The following fields make up the AVS capture header:

	Offset	Name		Type
	------------------------------
	0	version		uint32
	4	length		uint32
	8	mactime		uint64
	16	hosttime	uint64
	24	phytype		uint32
	28	channel		uint32
	32	datarate	uint32
	36	antenna		uint32
	40	priority	uint32
	44	ssi_type	uint32
	48	ssi_signal	int32
	52	ssi_noise	int32
	56	preamble	uint32
	60	encoding	uint32
	------------------------------
	64

The following subsections detail the fields of the capture header.

4.1 version
The version field identifies this type of frame as a subtype of
ETH_P_802111_CAPTURE as received by an ARPHRD_IEEE80211_PRISM or
an ARPHRD_IEEE80211_CAPTURE device.  The value of this field shall be
0x80211001.  As new revisions of this header are necessary, we can
increment the version appropriately.

4.2 length
The length field contains the length of the entire AVS capture header,
in bytes.

4.3 mactime
Many WLAN devices supply a relatively high resolution frame reception
time value.  This field contains the value supplied by the device.  If
the device does not supply a receive time value, this field shall be
set to zero.  The units for this field are nanoseconds.

4.4 hosttime
The hosttime field is set to the current value of the host maintained
clock variable when the frame is received.

4.5 phytype
The phytype field identifies what type of PHY is employed by the WLAN
device used to capture this frame.  The valid values are:

	PhyType			Value
	----------------------------------
	phytype_fhss_dot11_97	1
	phytype_dsss_dot11_97	2
	phytype_irbaseband	3
	phytype_dsss_dot11_b	4
	phytype_pbcc_dot11_b	5
	phytype_ofdm_dot11_g	6
	phytype_pbcc_dot11_g	7
	phytype_ofdm_dot11_a	8

4.6 channel
For all PHY types except FH, this field is just an unsigned integer
and will be set to the current receiver channel number at the time
the frame was received.  For frequency hopping radios, this field
is broken in to the following subfields:

	Byte	Subfield
	------------------------
	Byte0	Hop Set
	Byte1	Hop Pattern
	Byte2	Hop Index
	Byte3	reserved

4.7 datarate
The data rate field contains the rate at which the frame was received
in units of 100kbps.

4.8 antenna
For WLAN devices that indicate the receive antenna for each frame, the
antenna field shall contain an index value into the dot11AntennaList.
If the device does not indicate a receive antenna value, this field
shall be set to zero.

4.9 priority
The priority field indicates the receive priority of the frame.  The
value is in the range [0-15] with the value 0 reserved to indicate
contention period and the value 6 reserved to indicate contention free
period.

4.10 ssi_type
The ssi_type field is used to indicate what type of signal strength
information is present: "None", "Normalized RSSI" or "dBm".  "None"
indicates that the underlying WLAN device does not supply any signal
strength at all and the ssi_* values are unset.  "Normalized RSSI"
values are integers in the range [0-1000] where higher numbers
indicate stronger signal.  "dBm" values indicate an actual signal
strength measurement quantity and are usually in the range [-108 - 10].
The following values indicate the three types:

	Value	Description
	---------------------------------------------
	0	None
	1	Normalized RSSI
	2	dBm
	3 	Raw RSSI

4.11 ssi_signal
The ssi_signal field contains the signal strength value reported by
the WLAN device for this frame.  Note that this is a signed quantity
and if the ssi_type value is "dBm" that the value may be negative.

4.12 ssi_noise
The ssi_noise field contains the noise or "silence" value reported by
the WLAN device.  This value is commonly defined to be the "signal
strength reported immediately prior to the baseband processor lock on
the frame preamble".  If the hardware does not provide noise data, this
shall equal 0xffffffff.

4.12 preamble
For PHYs that support variable preamble lengths, the preamble field
indicates the preamble type used for this frame.  The values are:

	Value	Description
	---------------------------------------------
	0	Undefined
	1	Short Preamble
	2	Long Preamble

4.13 encoding
This specifies the encoding of the received packet.  For PHYs that support
multiple encoding types, this will tell us which one was used.

	Value	Description
	---------------------------------------------
	0	Unknown
	1	CCK
	2	PBCC
	3	OFDM
