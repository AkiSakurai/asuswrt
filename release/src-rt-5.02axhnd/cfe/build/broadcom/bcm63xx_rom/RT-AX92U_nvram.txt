# Set the MAC address of the Ethernet ports
# From 9/2009 onward MAC addresses have changed from an 8/16 split between macmid and the serial number, to a 12/12 split,
# so the new macmid will be based on MAC addresses with the following format:
#   47   40 39   32 31   24 23   16 15    8 7     0
#  |  00   |  90   |  4C   |  XX   |  XY   |  YY   |
# where the low 24 bits are evenly split into 4096 interface/ boardtypes and 4096 serial numbers. The low nibble of
# XXX cannot be 0, since that corresponds to an old style MAC address, and macmid will correspond to bits 23:12, so
# its easy to differentiate them from the old ones.
#
# The new "macmid" values will start at 1 and go up to 0xFFF, skipping those that have the low nibble as 0 and the
# ones with the patterns 0x04Ex and 0x04Fx (These restrictions are enforced in the code). To form the mac address,
# the whole OUI (00:90:4C) will be prepended to those values and 12 bits of serial number will be appended.
#
# A new-style macmid:
#   BCM947186nrh  0x008
#
# For router boards, nvserial now defines a new variable: "maclo12"
# so NVRAM text files for new boards will have to define the MAC address like this (for a macmid 0x008):
#   et0macaddr=00:90:4C:00:8${maclo12}
# instead of the previous way:

# Board revision.
# boardrev is a 16 bit number as follows:
# Bits [15:12] - Board Revision Type (brt), a 4 bit number with values:
#                0: Legacy (old boardrev numbering scheme - do not use)
#                1: Prototype "P" board.
#                2: Production "A" board.
#                3-15: Reserved.
# Bits [11:0] - Board revision, 12 bits which use BCD encoding to represent a decimal number between 0 and 999.
#
# Ex: A P304 board rev is 0x1304

# Maximum RF TX Power Parameters

# maxp2gaX parameters are the TX chain X (0-2) maximum TX output power for 2.4GHz
# units of 0.25dB
# max TX power for chain 0 
1:maxp2ga0=106
# max TX power for chain 1 
1:maxp2ga1=106
# max TX power for chain 2 
1:maxp2ga2=106


# PA Parameters

# PA parameters for sromrev=11 are defined in a "list" type format to conserve NVRAM space. See below for the list definitions.

# The pa2gaX parameters are the PA parameters for TX chain X (0-2), 2.4GHz PAs
# The parameter list is in the format of: word0 (a1), word1 (b0), word2 (b1)
# These will have to be replaced with values computed from real boards.
# PA parameters for chain 0:
1:pa2ga0=0xFFAC,0x231C,0xFB77
# PA parameters for chain 1:
1:pa2ga1=0xFFC7,0x2414,0xFB81
# PA parameters for chain 2:
#1:pa2ga2=0xFF39,0x1979,0xFCCB


# Power Detector Parameters

# Power detector offsets. These parameters are used to offset the measured RF power in 40MHz and 80MHz channels.
# This is needed for some RF front end designs that have a shift in measured power for wider bandwidth channels.
# 20MHz channels are assumed to have zero offset as the PA parameters are usually computed using 20MHz channels.

# pdoffset2g40ma0, pdoffset2g40ma1, and pdoffset2g40ma2 are the offsets for 2.4GHz, 40MHz channels, for chains 0-2.
# Each offset is four bits wide and is stored in twos compliment format. Units are 1/4 dB.
# Ex: 0x5 = +1.25dB offset, that is 1.25dB is added to the measured power to get the correct measured power.
1:pdoffset2g40ma0=0x7
1:pdoffset2g40ma1=0x7
#1:pdoffset2g40ma2=0x3


# Power-Per-Rate settings:

# General notes on these parameters:
#  - real_max_power[chain, rate] = max_power[chain] - total_power_offset[rate]
#  - The power offsets are in units of 0.5dB.
#  - Some offsets are signed offsets. Others are unsigned. Unless explicitly stated, offsets are unsigned.
#  - For sromrev=11, 11n rates mcs8-mcs15 and mcs16-mcs23 will have the same power-per-rate offsets corresponding to
#    mcs0-mcs7. Thus the power-per-rate offsets on each chain are not dependent on of the number of data streams.
#  - 11ac rates mcs0-mcs9 will have the same power-per-rate offsets on each chain irrespective of the number of streams.
#
# For 2.4GHz:
# Rate, SISO/MIMO Type/Bandwidth                      Total Power Offset

# Power detector offsets. These parameters are used to offset the measured RF power in 40MHz and 80MHz channels.
# This is needed for some RF front end designs that have a shift in measured power for wider bandwidth channels.
# 20MHz channels are assumed to have zero offset as the PA parameters are usually computed using 20MHz channels.

# pdoffset40ma0, pdoffset40ma1, and pdoffset40ma2 are the offsets for 5GHz, 40MHz channels, for chains 0-2.
# Each number is a 16-bit wide field that is broken up into four 4-bit offsets, one for each sub-band of 0-3.
# Sub-band 3 (X1) is in bits [15:12], sub-band 2 (high) in bits [11:8], sub-band 1 (mid) in bits [7:4], and sub-band 0 (low) in bits [3:0]
# Each offset is stored in twos compliment format. Units are 1/4 dB.
# Ex: 0x0500 = +1.25dB offset for sub-band 2, that is 1.25dB is added to the measured power to get the correct measured power.

# Each offset is stored in twos compliment format. Units are 1/4 dB.
# Ex: 0x00A0 = -1.5dB offset for sub-band 1, that is 1.5dB is subtraced from the measured power to get the correct measured power.

# Power-Per-Rate settings:
#
# General notes on these settings:
#   - real_max_power[chain, rate] = max_power[chain] - power_offset[rate]
#
#   - The power offset is in units of 0.5dB.
#       Note: Some offsets are signed offsets. Others are unsigned. Unless explicitly mentioned, offsets should be treated as unsigned.
#
#   - 11n rates mcs8-mcs15, mcs16-mcs23, and mcs24-mcs31 will have the same power-per-rate offsets corresponding to mcs0-mcs7.
#       In other words, the power-per-rate offsets on each chain are irrepsective of the number of streams
#
#   - 11ac rates mcs0-mcs9 will have the same power-per-rate offsets on each chain irrespective of the number of streams
#
#   - mcs32 uses the same power offsets as legacy 40Dup 6 Mbps
