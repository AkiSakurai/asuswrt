 * This defines an interface between the WLAN driver and clients which receive/transmit
 * native packets via the WLAN driver.
 * This interface provides APIs :
 *   - To send packets to the WLAN driver.
 *   - For clients like WPS, CnxAPI or TCP/IP stack to register their callbacks to receive frames.
 *   - Init pkt_forwarder registers callbacks with the WLAN driver.
