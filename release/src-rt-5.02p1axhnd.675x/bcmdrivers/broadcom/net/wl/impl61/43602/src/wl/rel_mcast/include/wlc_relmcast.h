/*
 *  Functional Decscription:
 *
 *  This feature provides acknowledgement for multicasting data packets(data packet only) so
 *  that some specific multicasting data packets can be reliably delivered. Current implementation
 *  can enable the acknowledgement for the multicast data frames by specifying the multicast ip
 *  address. The transmit rate of the reliable multicast frames also can be configured using
 *  IOVARs.
 *  For Tx side, use mcast_ackreq(ACK required) to enable waiting for ACK of multicasting data
 *  packets.
 *  Use mcast_ackip to specify the multicast addresses needs to be ACKed. After these packets
 *  transmitted, waiting for ACK to arrive else the packets will be retransmitted. Which station
 *  sending back ACK is chosen by RSSI value. The lower RSSI station and only one station will
 *  send ACK. The beacon IE includes the information about MAC address of ACK sender and
 *  which multicast address needs to be acked.
 *
 *  For Rx side, parsing the beacon IE to see whether to transmit ACK to the specified multicast
 *  packets. When a rxed multicast packet's MAC address(bottom 23bit) is matched, transmit an
 *  ACK.
