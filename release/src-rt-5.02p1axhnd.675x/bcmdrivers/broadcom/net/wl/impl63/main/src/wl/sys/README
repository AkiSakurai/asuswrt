Broadcom BCM43XX 802.11 wireless device driver source directory.

- "dot11" core hardware definitions are in d11.h
- 802.11 protocol definitions are in proto/802.11.h
- driver internal definitions shared between source files are in wlc.h

Driver source files are partitioned into os-independent "common"
files and os-dependent (per-"port") files.

Naming conventions:
The driver prefix is "wl" .
Port (os) specific files, routines, and data structures start with "wl_" .
Common (os-independent) files, routines, and data structures start with "wlc_" .
