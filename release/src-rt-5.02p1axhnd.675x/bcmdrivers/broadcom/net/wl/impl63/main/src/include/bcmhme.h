/**
 * HME: Memory Management policy.
 *
 * Segment Carving paradigm, is useful for carved allocation of variable sized
 * memory blocks, that persist for the operational duration of the system. This
 * scheme may be used when all blocks are intended to be freed simulataneously,
 * effectively freeing the entire HME memory. E.g. PCIE_IPC_HME_USER_MACIFS.
 *
 * Pool of fixed size memory blocks, with free blocks identified using a
 * dongle resident multi word bitmap.
 *
 * Split-Coalesce support is a WIP. Requires a walk of the free block list in
 * host memory using backplane accesses over PCIE. E.g. PCIE_IPC_HME_USER_LCLPKT
 * Split-Coalesce helps reduce internal and external fragmentation at an
 * exhorbitant cost of CPU cycles for backplane accesses of free-block list.
 * Split-Coalesce paradigm is appropriate when there is a large disparity in
 * typical block-sizes and the sojourn time of allocated blocks.
 *
 * Memory may be allocated from the HME region ONLY after the Dongle and DHD
 * handshake has completed, i.e. the PCIE IPC Link Phase completed.

 *                 When a well known HME User Id is specified in hme_user_id, a
 *                 block will be allocated from the users pool allocator, and
 *                 serve as the destination host memory.
 *                 Otherwise, the host memory need not be a HME block.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *    src_daddr32: source dongle memory address
 *    dst_haddr64: pointer to a 64bit destination host memory address
 *                 When hme_user_id == HME_USER_NOOP, a pointer to a valid host
 *                 memory address that may or may not belong to a HME.
 *                 When hme_user_id is a well known HME user id, a HME block
 *                 will be allocated, and its address will be returned through

 *    len        : Length of the D2H DMA transfer.
 *    sync       : boolean to request a spin loop until xfer completes. User
 *                 may initiate the transfer and later explicitly invoke
 *                 hme_d2h_sync() to sync on transfer completion.
 *   hme_user_id:  HME_USER_NOOP or one of the well known HME User IDs.
 *                 When a well known HME User is specified, the User's memory
 *                 extension must be managed by hme_mgr_pool_t.
 *                 No support for other HME memory managers.
