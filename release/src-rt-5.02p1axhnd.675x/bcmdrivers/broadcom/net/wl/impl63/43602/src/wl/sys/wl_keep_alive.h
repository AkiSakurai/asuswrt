/*
 * Keep-alive offloading.
 *
 *	This feature implements periodic keep-alive packet transmission offloading.
 * The intended purpose is to keep an active session within a network address
 * translator (NAT) with a public server. This allows incoming packets sent
 * by the public server to the STA to traverse the NAT.
 *
 * An example application is to keep an active session between the STA and
 * a call control server in order for the STA to be able to receive incoming
 * voice calls.
 *
 * The keep-alive functionality is offloaded from the host processor to the
 * WLAN processor to eliminate the need for the host processor to wake-up while
 * it is idle; therefore, conserving power.
