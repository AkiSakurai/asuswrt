/*
 * Network interface packet buffer routines. These are used internally by the
 * driver to allocate/de-allocate packet buffers, and manipulate the buffer
 * contents and attributes.
 *
 * This implementation is specific to LBUF (linked buffer) packet buffers.
 *
 * This source file is provided as a template for the functions that must
 * be ported to interface to a network (TCP/IP) stack. The template
 * functions allow the driver to be tested in a standalone mode
 * (no TCP/IP stack).
