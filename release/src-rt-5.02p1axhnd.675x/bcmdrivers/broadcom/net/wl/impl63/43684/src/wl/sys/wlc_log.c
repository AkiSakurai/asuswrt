/**
 * @file
 * @brief
 * The WLAN driver currently has tight coupling between different components. In particular,
 * components know about each other, and call each others functions, access data, and invoke
 * callbacks. This means that maintenance and new features require changing these
 * relationships. This is fundamentally a tightly coupled system where everything touches
 * many other things.
 *
 * @brief
 * We can reduce the coupling between our features by reducing their need to directly call
 * each others functions, and access each others data. An mechanism for accomplishing this is
 * a generic event signaling mechanism. The event infrastructure enables modules to communicate
 * indirectly through events, rather than directly by calling each others routines and
 * callbacks.
