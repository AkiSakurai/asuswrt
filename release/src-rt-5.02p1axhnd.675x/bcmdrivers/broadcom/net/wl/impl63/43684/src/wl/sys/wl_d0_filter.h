 * Dongle packet filter.
 *
 * This feature implements a packet filter engine that determines whether
 * packets received by the dongle are forwarded to the host processor.
 *
 * When packet filters are installed, received packets are run through the
 * set of enabled filters. The filter criteria is specified by the host
 * application. If a match is found, the configured action is performed.
 *
 * If no packet filters are installed, no special filtering is performed.
 * Received packets are forwarded to the host as normal.
 *
 * The host application creates filters based upon packet content pattern
 * matches - it specifies an offset within received packets to start matching,
 * the pattern to match, the size of the pattern, and a bitmask that indicates
 * which bits within the pattern should be matched. The bitmask used for filter
 * pattern matching uses a bit-for-bit bitmask. Each bit of the pattern can
 * be selectively matched, in order to support sub-byte matches.
 *
 * Host applications can install multiple packet filters, and each can be
 * independently enabled or disabled.
 *
 * Each filter is independent. i.e. There is a match if any of the filters match.
 * The filter results are not ANDed together.
 *
 * The filter engine must be configured to perform an action based upon the
 * filter match results. Two actions are supported:
 *
 *   - Forward packets from dongle to host on match, else discard packet (default).
 *   - Discard packets on match, else forward packet from dongle to host.
 *
 * This allows the filter engine to be configured to either forward packets
 * that match any of the enabled filters. Or, alternatively, to forward packets
 * that do not match any of the enabled filters. Received packets iterate
 * through only the list of enabled filters. If a match is found, the
 * requested "match" action is performed (without iterating through any
 * remaining enabled filters). If no match is found after iterating through
 * all enabled filters, the requested "non-match" action is performed.
 *
 * In addition, each filter has an associated match action "polarity"
 * attribute. This allows the result of each filter match to be negated.
 * For example, to create a filter to discard all packets except UDP,
 * create a pattern match filter for UDP, set the polarity attribute, and
 * configure the filter engine to discard packets on match. Note, that this
 * has the same result as creating a pattern match filter for UDP, not setting
 * the polarity attribute, and configuring the filter engine to forward
 * packets on match. However, the polarity attribute is useful in situations
 * where multiple filters are enabled. e.g. discard all non-UDP packets, and
 * discard all UDP packets with source port xxx.
