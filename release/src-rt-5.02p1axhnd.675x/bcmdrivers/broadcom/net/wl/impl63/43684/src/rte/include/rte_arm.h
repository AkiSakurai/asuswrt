 * arm bootloader memory is remapped but backplane addressing is 0-based

 * Background: since the mask rom bootloader code executes in a
 * read-only memory space apart from SoC RAM, data addresses
 * specified by bootloader code must be decoded differently from
 * text addresses. Consequently, the processor must run in a
 * "memory remap" mode whereby data addresses containing the
 * MEMORY_REMAP bit are decoded as residing in SoC RAM. However,
 * backplane agents, e.g., the dma engines, always use 0-based
 * addresses for SoC RAM, regardless of processor mode.
 * Consequently it is necessary to strip the MEMORY_REMAP bit
 * from addresses programmed into backplane agents.
