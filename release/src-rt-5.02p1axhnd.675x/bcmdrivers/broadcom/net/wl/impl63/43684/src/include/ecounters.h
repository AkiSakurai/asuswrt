 * req: Ecounters report request that came down from the host

 *	For example, if the callback could not fit all its data in
 *	buffer provided, the cookie may contain some opaque
 *	information  about where the callback left off.
 *	When the ecounters framework calls it again with a bigger buffer,
 *	this cookie could help the callback continue to continue from
 *	where it left off.
 * attempted_write_len: If this function could not write data in the
 *	buffer provided in XTLV buffer context, tell the framework
 *	how many bytes the function attempted to write. Ecounters framework
 *	will call this callback again with a bigger buffer.
 *	If this field is populated, the callback function needs to decide
 *	if the cookie needs to be populated.
 * tlv: Some client callbacks may need to look into the payload of requested
 *	XTLV type for reporting purposes. This parameter give access to the
 *	payload of the requested XTLV type
 *
 * Some rules in coding a client callback function:
 * 1.  Note on when to set attempted_write_len. attempted_write_len essentially
 *	means how much a callback attempted to write in a single call to
 *	bcm_xtlv_put_data(). If that functions returns BCME_NOMEM or
 *	BCME_BUFTOOSHORT, the callback is supposed to tell the framework
 *	how much more buffer space it needs to report stats.
 *	atempted_write_len cannot be > 1024.
 * 2. cookie: Ecounters framework will call the callback multiple times if
 *	the client callback function returned BCME_NOMEM or BCME_BUFTOOSHORT.
 *	It is the responsibility of the client callback to store the state of
 *	where it left off during stats population. If the client function
 *	successfully wrote all its data in the buffer then it must return
 *	BCME_OK and clear cookie.
 * 3. When there is no space in the buffer provided, the client function must
 *	return BCME_BUFTOOSHORT or BCME_NOMEM.
 * 4. All XTLV records must be aligned to word boundaries.
 * 5. Client function must not access/manipulate XTLV buffer context directly
 *	All clients must use BCM XTLV APIs to write XTLVs records to buffer
 * 6. A callback function must be registered only once for a given reportable
 *	stats type. The context information registered with ecounters
 *	framework along with other parameters passed at the time of
 *	stats collection must be sufficient to deliver necessary stats.
