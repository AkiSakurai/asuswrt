/* These functions are implementations for the templates provided by threadX in tx_low_power.c.
 * The functions have been renamed to avoid symbol conflicts and are implemented in this source
 * file to avoid modifying the threadX source.
 *
 * Modifications have been made to this module to suit the Broadcom device which uses a hardware
 * timer to schedule an interrupt when the next software timer expires. This interrupt will also
 * wake the processor from WFI during low power mode.
 *
 * To avoid a race condition, hardware timer programming will happen directly in the PMU ISR and
 * when a software timer is started. The ISR will also advance the ThreadX time and invoke
 * _tx_timer_interrupt() to run the callbacks of any expired software timers.
 *
 * threadx_low_power_enter() will not do any hardware timer programming as we assume this has
 * already been done at that point. It takes any actions needed to bring the device in low power
 * mode. These actions will be undone in threadx_low_power_exit().
