/*
 * A small package for keeping smoothed mean values and
 * smoothed mean deviations, based loosely on the
 * floating point examples of TCP round trip time functions.
 *
 * All integer arithmetic.
 * Sample values are integers.
 * Frac_Bits is the number of bits to the right of the decimal point.
 * Div_Bits is the log-base-2 of the divisor used for smoothing. It corresponds
 *    loosely to the number of samples included in the smoothed estimate.
 * The get_smean() and get_sdev() functions return integers.
 *
 * Note: There are no overflow checks at present.
